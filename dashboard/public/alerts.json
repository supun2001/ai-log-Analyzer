This could be a suspicious activity, as this file contains sensitive information about who has access to certain resources on a computer system.\n\nIt's like finding out that someone has altered a critical document, like a password list, without your knowledge or permission."

The hacker sent a request to your website with a URL that looked like this: `/login.php?user=admin'--`.\n2. This URL included extra characters (`'--`) at the end, which are not part of normal user input.\n3. Your website's database tried to execute this code as if it was valid user input.\n\n**Why is it bad:** Injecting bad code like this can allow hackers to access sensitive data or take control of your website.\n\n**What does it mean for you:** This security alert indicates that your website has a vulnerability that needs to be fixed. You should investigate and patch this issue to prevent further attacks.\n\nThink of it like trying to log in to a secure building with an invalid keycard. The bad code is the invalid input, and your system's database tried to execute it as if it was legitimate."
